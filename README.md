# MySweeper
My implementation of a web-based mine-sweeper game.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Currently supported

- Left click to reveal, right-click for flag
- Auto-reveal all cells surrounding an empty cell.
- Stop game when mine is hit.

### To Do
In no particular order:
- [ ] Take size of board from user input.
- [ ] Add counter of remaining mines.
- [ ] Add checker for finished game (according to revealed tiles, not flags)
- [ ] Add timer.
- [ ] Make sure no empty board is generated.
