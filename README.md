# MySweeper
My implementation of a web-based mine-sweeper game.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Currently supported

- Left click to reveal, right-click for flag.
  - A flag can't be revealed. Right-click again to undo.
- Auto-reveal all cells surrounding an empty cell.
- Stop game when mine is hit.
- Difficulty selection (easy/medium/hard) which changes the amount of mines.

### To Do
In no particular order:
- [ ] Take size of board from user input.
- [x] Add difficulty selection by the user.
- [ ] Add counter of remaining mines.
- [ ] Add checker for finished game (according to revealed tiles, not flags)
- [ ] Add timer.
- [x] Make sure no empty board is generated.
