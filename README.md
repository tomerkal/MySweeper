# MySweeper
My implementation of a web-based mine-sweeper game.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Currently supported

- Left click to reveal, right-click for flag

### To Do
In no particular order:
- Take size of board from user input.
- Add counter of remaining mines.
- Add checker for finished game (according to revealed tiles, not flags)
- Add timer.
